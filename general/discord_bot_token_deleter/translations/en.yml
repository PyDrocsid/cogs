title: Discord Bot Token Deleter
description: >
  You have sent a message with a Discord bot token into this channel.
  I deleted this message because other people can use this token to control your bot!
  You can regenerate the token in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications):
    - Select the application
    - Click on "Bot" in the side menu
    - Click on "Regenerate" to regenerate the token
not_deleted: >
  [This message]({}) contains a Discord bot token but I could not delete it because I don't have `manage_messages` permission in {}.
